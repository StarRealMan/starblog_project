## Brief

I am a Master student in the [School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation](http://smea.hitsz.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Harbin Institute of Technology, ShenZhen](http://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Haoyao Chen](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/chenhaoyao). Prior to HITSZ, I obtained a B.Eng from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), and majored in  elctrical engineering in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Automation](http://hitee.hit.edu.cn/).

I am a research intern (May. 2021 - September. 2021) at Megvii Research Center of [Megvii](https://megvii.com/) (Beijing, China). In my undergraduate study, I was an team member of control group in [Harbin Institute of Technology Competition Robotics Team ](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%93%88%E5%B0%94%E6%BB%A8%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E7%AB%9E%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%BA%E9%98%9F) (HITCRT), named I Hiter (Harbin, China).

## Research

I am interested in SLAM, computer vision and robotics. Currently I am working on my graduation project about creating marked object map using 3D reconstruction and 3D pointcloud semantic segmentation method. In the future research, I am eager to develop new methods by combining multiple sensors to help computers understand surroundings better and interact with environment smarterly, which is a key problem faced by Autonomous Driving Cars and Navigation Robots.

## Competitions

As a member of control group of HIT Competition Robotics Team, I am mainly responsible for coding and designing the control algorithm for the robots in the [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) 2019. We ranked [6/200+](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/announcement/1035) in the competition.
In 2020 and 2021, I become the Technical Director of HIT Competition Robotics Team, mainly responsible of developing high performance robot actuator and designing accurate robot positioning and navigation algorithm. We both won First Prize in the competition of [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) and [Robocon](http://www.robocon2021.com/) 2020.

## Skills

C / C++ / Python / Matlab, Linux / Embedded Programing, Pytorch / OpenCV.
