## Brief

I am a Master student in the [School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation](http://smea.hitsz.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Harbin Institute of Technology, ShenZhen](http://www.hitsz.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Haoyao Chen](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/chenhaoyao). Prior to HITSZ, I obtained a B.Eng from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), and majored in  elctrical engineering in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Automation](http://hitee.hit.edu.cn/).

I am a research intern (May. 2021 - September. 2021) at Megvii Research Center of [Megvii](https://megvii.com/) (Beijing, China). In my undergraduate study, I was a team member of the control group in [Harbin Institute of Technology Competition Robotics Team ](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%93%88%E5%B0%94%E6%BB%A8%E5%B7%A5%E4%B8%9A%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E7%AB%9E%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%BA%E9%98%9F) (HITCRT), named I Hiter (Harbin, China).

## Research

I am interested in SLAM, computer vision and robotics. Currently I am working on my graduation project, which is about creating marked object map using 3D reconstruction and 3D pointcloud semantic segmentation methods. In my future research, I am eager to develop new methods by combining multiple sensors to help computers understand surroundings better and interact with environments smarterly, which is a key problem faced by Autonomous Driving Cars and Navigation Robots.

## Competitions

As a member of the control group of HIT Competition Robotics Team, I am mainly responsible for coding and designing the control algorithm for the robots in the [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) 2019. We ranked [6/200+](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/announcement/1035) in the competition.
In 2020 and 2021, I became the Technical Director of HIT Competition Robotics Team, mainly responsible for developing high performance robot actuator and designing accurate robot positioning and navigation algorithms. We both won First Prize in the competitions of [Robomaster](https://www.robomaster.com/en-US) and [Robocon](http://www.robocon2021.com/) 2020.

## Projects

Besides joining in competitions, I and my team members also joined Innovation and Entrepreneurship Projects.

We build up a Hand Exoskeleton which can help patients with muscle weakness to lift up heavy things and rehab.
This project has won Silver Medal in China College Students' 'Internet+' Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and Silver Medal in 'Zu Guang' Cup.

We also designed a strong PMSM system from hardware to software which is widely used in our robots.
We have submit a patent application for this PMSM system.
